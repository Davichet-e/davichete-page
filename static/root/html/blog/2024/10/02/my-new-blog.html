        <main><p>Since my first years of college, I always knew I would end up building my own blog from scratch. What I didn't know, is that it would take me so long to start to do it! But finally, I've decided to stop procrastinating it and start building it.</p>


<p>I want to make it iteratively, starting with a minimal working version, without tags, comments etc. Just plain text, just a simple markdown to html. And whenever I want/have time, keep adding features.
</p>
<h2>Why now?</h2>
<p>I've recently moved to Eindhoven, in the Netherlands, and I thought it was a good time to finally finish it. It was on my drawer of <i>almost</i> done things for 2 years now
</p>
<h2>What will you write about?</h2>
<p>About anything, probably most of it related to technology. I will share my views about programming languages, about the tech industry, working methodologies, etc.
</p>
<h2>How is this website done?</h2>
<p>This website is written with a custom Markdown parser written in Rust, no libraries, just bare Rust code. You can find the parser I wrote <a href="https://github.com/Davichet-e/md2html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> 
</p>
<h2>I have a question regarding the parser</h2>
<p>If you have any question regarding my parser, feel free to post an issue on the repo. I'm sure I can learn a lot from your comments
</p>
<h2>Why not use a SSG (Static Site Generator) like <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hugo</a> or <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11y</a></h2>
<p>I wanted to do it on my own, I was curious about how hard would it be to write my own markdown parser. Furthermore, if I were to "waste" my time building a blog, I preferred not to fight with a tool. If I wanted to customize anything, instead of going though docs, wikis, etc. I thought it would be on the long term just easier to do it on my own and customize it to my needs.
